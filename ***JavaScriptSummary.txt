i know one is server side scripting and the other is browser side

PHP is a programming language. It is often used for server side programming, but has uses in general programming too.

JavaScript is a programming language. It is the only language that has a decent level of native support for running in a browser. It has a wide variety of server side implementations (including Node and ASP). It is one of the languages you can use with the Windows Scripting Host. etc.

There are plenty of other languages that can be used for server side web programming too (C# is popular in ASP.NET, I'm rather fond of Perl, there are quite a lot of proponents of Python and Ruby, Java has a strong following, and so on).

If we take your question to be about the difference between server side and client side programming thoughâ€¦
